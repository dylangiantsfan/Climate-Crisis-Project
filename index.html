        <h2>A Vital Species in Danger</h2>
        <p>
          Frogs and other amphibian species are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate change.
          Without action, it is very possible we will see catastrophic ecological effects stemming from the loss of these creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Science is clear, Frog populations are experiencing a global decline due to a combination of factors, including habitat loss, climate change, pollution,
          invasive species, and disease. Scientists predict that one-third to one-half of the nearly 7,600 known amphibian species, including frogs, will become extinct in the next ten years. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The faster we take action, the more likely it is we can save this wonderful species before it is too late!

        <h2>Why Frogs Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Frogs play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance. They
          consume large quantities of insects, including those that transmit disease
          and damage human crops. Due to their extreme sensitivity to environmental changes,
          they are also indicators of the general health of an ecosystem.

        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>There are many things that we can do individually to help our ribbity friends in danger. Avoid
          using any form of pesticides, as these can harm frogs directly and elimianates their main source of food.
          Create a frog friendly habitat in your yard, having a pond or birdbath gives a clean water source for frogs too
          hydrate and breed. Try your best to reduce your use of plastic and fossil fuels, as these contribute to climate change
          and pollution which damages frog's environment.
